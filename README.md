# CPIT425-Information-Security-Course-Project
### A software that illustrates steps to exchange an encrypted keys and messages securely between two users.
----------------------------------------
##  Project Description 

1. Create software that can encrypt and decrypt a text as input in CBC mode using AES. 
2. Then encrypt the key used in the first step using RSA algorithm. 
3. The software should decrypt the key using RSA first then decrypt the message using AES in CBC mode.
